# Docker workshop

A simple `docker` workshop for beginners, that attempts to drive you through the fundamentals and into some advanced topics like `docker-compose` or `docker swarm mode`.

This is, of course, a continuous work in progress; feel free to propose changes.

If you want to follow this, go ahead to the `0-docker-basics` dir.
